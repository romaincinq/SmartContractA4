# SmartContractA4

Welcome to my Github repository. 

My name is Romain CINQUILLI and I'm not in a group, so I done everything by myself for this TP. 

In this GitHub you will find Canevas and Smart Contract that I made during my 4th year a ESILV.

In this repository, they are 3 files :
 
 -TP1 about the smart contract on the vote
 
 -TP2 about the smart contract on the Token 
 
 -TP3 about the smart contract on the Proof of existence (using SHA256).
 
 I hope you will enjoy your visit on this repository and i'm thankful for what you allow us to learn about blockchain this year. 
 
 Good continuation,
 
 Best regards
