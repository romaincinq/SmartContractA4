# SmartContractA4

Welcome to my github repository. 

My name is Romain CINQUILLI and I'm not in group, so i done everything alone by myself for this course. 

In this GitHub you will find some Caneva about Smart Contract that I made during my 4th year a ESILV.

In this repository, they are 3 files :
 
 -TP1 about the smart contract on the vote
 
 -TP2 about the smart contract on the Token 
 
 -TP3 about the smart contract on the Proof of existence.
 
 I'm really sorry but i couldn't realise the smart contract on the TP3 so there is just the caneva and no code associate to it for this one.
 
 I hope you will enjoy your visit on this repository and i'm thankful for what you allow us to learn about blockchain this year. 
 
 Good continuation,
 
 Best regards
